## Turning ai-basic-hosting-model.md into an SVG

THIS PATH MOSTLY WORKED (lost colors, but restored with AI)

there are two big boxes here acting as visual containers - change the background color of the smaller one on the left to be rgb(200, 227, 255)

and change the background color of the larger one to the right to be rgb(226, 235, 243)

## Turning ai-basic-hosting-model.md into an SVG

THIS PATH DIDN'T WORK

First, extract Mermaid part into ai-basic-hosting-model.mmd.

Then install and run CLI:

https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli

1. `npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`
2. `mmdc -i ai-basic-hosting-model.mmd -o ai-basic-hosting-model.svg`
